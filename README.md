Inventor of the dust logger laser probe deployed throughout Antarctica and Greenland. [**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/research/blob/master/papers/t13J068.pdf) explaining how the dust logger is used to map ancient records in deep ice sheets.

High-sensitivity laser fluorescence detector as part of a flow-cytometry and genomic study of marine cyanobacteria evolution in ancient ice. (https://www.biogeosciences.net/9/3799/2012/

[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/research/blob/master/papers/2009JD013741.pdf) describing an automated custom algorithm using speech-recognition techniques to synthesize paleoclimate records from a laser scattering map of South Pole ice.

Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation in heterogenous ice ([**cyl.c**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/research/blob/master/cyl.c)) This MC analysis is used in original [**paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/research/blob/master/papers/GRL2001.pdf) describing the invention of the dustlogger.

[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/research/blob/master/papers/Bipolar.correlation.PNAS.pdf) using original data and Monte Carlo methods to determine statistical significance of a correlation between volcanic eruptions and climate change over 70,000 years.

[**PhD thesis**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/research/blob/master/papers/bay_thesis.pdf) search of a supercomputer database for neutrinos arriving in correlation with extra-galactic explosions.  [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6510) describing an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis. [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05390) describing machine techniques for neutrino experiments.<br><br>
